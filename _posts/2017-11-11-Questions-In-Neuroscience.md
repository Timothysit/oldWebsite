# Meta-questions 

- How to we build better hardware which will better allow us to record from the brain? 
- How do we streamline the process of analysing neural activity? 
  + currently, much of the tools for analysing neural activity seems "home-made", sometimes with code mentioned in papers that are not publicly available and no unifying organisation of approahces; their advantages, disadvantages, how they relate to other types of analyses etc. 
  + I think much can be learnt from how the machine learning community does this. Mostly by making code publicly available. (Just look at how quickly it was for Hinton et al's Capsules to be published, then made available in Python)
