This is part of "The Blog Project". 
Start date: 20171028
There are no specific goals in this project, but since I have gotten quite into computational neuroscience and data anlaysis recently, I aim to build blog as a platform to share some data analysis that I will do. 

Some ideas of data analysis project to do that may be interseting: 

- build a network of all the facts from QI / No such Thing as a fish. Some simple statistics of their domains, and their relation. 
- the self quantification project. But I am not sure how much I want to share my quantified self to the world 
- sometimes I think of general questions, I may then try to gather some data on it and see what I can find. (Some randome ones I thought about include average faces of people, frequency of words in certain books etc.)
